            <h1>THE 5 MOST <span>DESTRUCTIVE</span><br>TSUNAMIS IN HISTORY</h1>
            <p>Tsunamis have occurred often throughout history. So frequently in Japan, in fact, that they invented<br>the word specificallyfor the phenomenon: ‘tsu‘ meaning harbour and ‘nami‘ meaning wave.<br>
            “It’s actually quite frightening to think that this [Japanese tsunami] event is smaller than the 2004<br> Indian Ocean tsunami, smaller even than the 1960 Chilean tsunami, yet the damage to Japan’s people<br> and economy is still profound.”</p><br>
            <div class="research"><h2>1. Sumatra, Indonesia – 26 December 2004</h2>
                <p class="par">The 9.1 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Sumatra was estimated to occur at a depth of 30 km.<br> The fault zone that caused the tsunami was roughly 1300 km long, vertically displacing the sea floor by several metres along that length. <br>The ensuing tsunami was as tall as 50 m, reaching 5 km inland near Meubolah, Sumatra. This tsunami is also the most widely recorded, with nearly one thousand combined tide gauge and eyewitness measurements from around the world reporting a rise in wave height, including places in the US, the UK and Antarctica. An estimated US$10b of damages is attributed to the disaster, with around 230,000 people reported dead.</p>

            <div class="research"><h2>2. North Pacific Coast, Japan – 11 March 2011</h2>
                <p class="par">A powerful tsunami travelling 800km per hour with 10m-high waves swept over the east coast of Japan, killing more than 18,000 people. The tsunami was spawned by an 9.0 magnitude earthquake that reached depths of 24.4km- making it the fourth-largest earthquake ever recorded. Approximately 452,000 people were relocated to shelters, and still remain displaced from their destroyed homes. The violent shaking resulted in a nuclear emergency, in which the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant began leaking radioactive steam. The World Bank estimates that it could take Japan up to five years to financially overcome the $235 billion damages.</p>

            <div class="research"><h2>3. Lisbon, Portugal – 1 November 1755</h2>
                <p class="par">A magnitude 8.5 earthquake caused a series of three huge waves to strike various towns along the west coast of Portugal and southern Spain, up to 30 m high, in some places. The tsunami affected waves as far away as Carlisle Bay, Barbados, where waves were said to rise by 1.5 m. The earthquake and ensuing tsunami killed 60,000 in the Portugal, Morocco and Spain.

            <div class="research"><h2>4. Krakatau, Indonesia – 27 August 1883</h2>
                <p class="par">This tsunami event is actually linked to the explosion of the Krakatau caldera volcano. Multiple waves as high as 37 m were propagated by the violent eruptions and demolished the towns of Anjer and Merak. The sea was reported to recede from the shore at Bombay, India and is said to have killed one person in Sri Lanka. This event killed around 40,000 people in total; however, as many as 2,000 deaths can be attributed directly to the volcanic eruptions, rather than the ensuing tsunami.</p>

            <div class="research"><h2>5. Enshunada Sea, Japan – 20 September 1498</h2>
                <p class="par">An earthquake, estimated to have been at least magnitude 8.3, caused tsunami waves along the coasts of Kii, Mikawa, Surugu, Izu and Sagami. The waves were powerful enough to breach a spit, which had previously separated Lake Hamana from the sea. There were reports of homes flooding and being swept away throughout the region, with a total of at least 31,000 people killed.</p>
